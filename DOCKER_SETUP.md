# Trading Robot Docker Setup Guide

## ðŸš€ Quick Start for End Users

This trading robot is fully containerized with Docker. Users only need to install Docker Desktop to run the entire application.

### Prerequisites

1. **Install Docker Desktop**
   - Windows: Download from [Docker Desktop for Windows](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
   - Make sure Docker Desktop is running before proceeding

### Installation Steps

1. **Download the Trading Robot package**
   - Extract all files to a folder (e.g., `C:\trading-robot\`)

2. **Run the Control Panel**
   ```cmd
   cmd /c menu.bat
   ```

3. **Choose Startup Option**
   - **Option 4: Reliable Start** (Recommended for distribution)
   - This option handles network issues and provides retry logic

### Available Startup Options

| Option | Description | Best For |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| 1. Quick Start | Fast one-click startup | Daily use |
| 2. Full Start | Detailed startup process | First-time setup |
| 3. Development Mode | Manual service control | Developers |
| **4. Reliable Start** | **Network-resilient startup** | **Distribution** |
| 5. Check Status | View service health | Monitoring |
| 6. View Logs | Debug information | Troubleshooting |
| 7. Stop Services | Clean shutdown | Maintenance |

### Access URLs

After successful startup:
- **Frontend**: http://localhost:3000
- **API Documentation**: http://localhost:8000/docs
- **Backend API**: http://localhost:8000

### Troubleshooting

#### Network Issues
If you encounter Docker image download problems:

1. **Setup Docker Mirror** (Option 11)
   - Configures faster image sources
   - Especially useful in China

2. **Fix Network Issues** (Option 12)
   - Provides network diagnostics
   - Multiple solution strategies

#### Common Issues

**Docker not starting:**
- Ensure Docker Desktop is installed and running
- Check system requirements for Docker Desktop

**Port conflicts:**
- Make sure ports 3000, 8000, 5432, 6379 are not in use
- Stop other applications using these ports

**Slow startup:**
- First run downloads Docker images (may take 5-10 minutes)
- Subsequent runs are much faster
